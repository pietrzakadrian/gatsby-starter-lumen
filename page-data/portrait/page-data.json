In order to be able to answer the question: who is <strong>Adrian Pietrzak</strong>? — I will describe my way from childhood to where I am today.</p>\n<p>I have always been interested in web technologies and was exposed to them at a very young age. I started learning HTML and CSS when the Internet was just beginning. I launched my first website when I was 10 years old: <a href=\"https://komiksy.pl.tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://komiksy.pl.tl</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"first-time\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#first-time\" aria-label=\"first time permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>First time</h2>\n<p>In 2011, I began my first YouTube channel where I posted gameplay videos, and that’s when I started building a community. A few years later, I changed my content to entertainment and learned how to create viral videos. Within a few months, my channel had 250k subscribers. By placing ads on the videos, I was able to generate a decent income from it. This marked my first experience in online business.</p>\n<h2 id=\"programming\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#programming\" aria-label=\"programming permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Programming</h2>\n<p>I enrolled in part-time IT studies and started looking for a job. At the age of 20, I embarked on my career as a software developer in a small software house. This allowed me to acquire a multitude of new skills and gain valuable experience in the e-commerce industry. Simultaneously, I worked on my open-source application, which garnered over 1k stars on github.com. My code proved to be immensely helpful to many developers worldwide. The same software became a part of my engineering thesis, which I successfully defended in early 2021.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It will continue,<br>\nAdrian Pietrzak</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Portrait","date":null,"description":null,"socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/portrait//portrait"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","2764776372","401334301","63107425"]}
