However, after this time I am back and hopefully permanently. My programming skills have developed a lot since the last time I wrote on my blog. I owe this to my curiosity for technology and advanced programming tools. In this article, I will provide you with an updated list of applications that I use on a daily basis in my work.","category":"Software Development","title":"Software Development & Programming Tools in 2022","date":"2022-09-14T22:40:32.169Z","tags":["Computer Setup","Programming Tools"],"slug":"/blog/software-development-and-programming-tools-in-2022"}}},{"node":{"timeToRead":21,"fields":{"categorySlug":"/blog/category/software-engineering/","slug":"/posts/2022-02-13---NestJS-Authentication-Series-User-Registration//blog/nestjs-authentication-series/user-registration","tagSlugs":["/blog/tag/typescript/","/blog/tag/nodejs/","/blog/tag/nestjs/"]},"frontmatter":{"description":"Welcome you to my blog series on user authentication in the NestJS framework.
