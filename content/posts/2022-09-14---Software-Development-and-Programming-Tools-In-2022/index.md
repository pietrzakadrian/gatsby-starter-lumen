Welcome back! ðŸ”¥
I haven't written anything in a long time, as I've been very busy for the past six months. However, after this time I am back and hopefully permanently.

My programming skills have developed a lot since the last time I wrote on my blog. I owe this to my curiosity for technology and advanced programming tools.

In this article, I will provide you with an updated list of applications that I use on a daily basis in my work.

> **Note**: I have already written [one such article in October 2021](https://pietrzakadrian.com/blog/my-software-development-setup-and-programming-tools-october-2021). You can check how much this list has changed.

# IDE

I have been using Visual Studio Code for many years. Here I wanted to show you my settings.json file, however, since I started using [**IntelliJ IDEA**](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), the quality of my projects has gone to a much higher level. ðŸ“ˆ

The code editor is ready to use right out of the box. It is not a free license, but it is definitely worth investing in.

## Theme

I was looking for a good theme. I had been in love with [Ayu Mirage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teabyii.ayu) for many years, but this year that changed.

For me, it was important that there was not too strong a contrast between the source code and the background. I think I have found my true love.

[**Nord**](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10321-nord) is the best theme I have ever used. The oceanic look is very calming and allows for maximum focus. ðŸŒŠ

> **Note**: Nord theme is also used in code listings on my blog.

## Plugins

As I wrote above, IntelliJ is ready to work efficiently right out of the box. However, the available plug-ins can significantly speed up writing source code and improve quality.

1. [**Tabnine: Code Faster with AI Code Completions**](https://www.tabnine.com/) is an alternative to Copilot (free, local option, privacy). It suggests what you want to write and is extremely accurate at it. I can't imagine programming today without this tool. The value of Tabnine in terms of productivity. Tabnine for [enterprises](https://www.tabnine.com/enterprise);
2. [**Prettier**](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10456-prettier) is a very good tool for formatting code;
3. [**Key Promoter X**](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9792-key-promoter-x) is a plugin for displaying keyboard shortcut prompts to perform given actions faster;
4. [**.ignore**](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7495--ignore) is a plugin that supports ignoring files added to the repository (via .gitignore file).

That's all that can be useful. All other tools are built into the IDE.

# Terminal

Terminal is the second most important tool for working as a software developer. If you are looking for something modern, [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) will be a good option for you.

I prefer the standard solutions that [**iTerm2**](https://iterm2.com/) offers - it works very well.

In addition, I use the **zsh** shell with **zsh-autosuggestions**, **zsh-syntax-highlighting**, **Web Search** plugins and [**Oh My Zsh**](https://ohmyz.sh/) framework. I recommend using the [**Ayu Mirage theme iTerm**](https://github.com/hwyncho/ayu-iTerm).

# Focus

One of my biggest discoveries that has increased my productivity by 300% is getting into the right state of focus. It may sound surprising, but that's what it's all about.

[**Endel**](https://code.endel.io/?code=adrianpietrzak) is a sound wellness app helping you focus, relax, and sleep and backed by neuroscience. Available on multiple platforms, it creates soundscapes that adapt to your heart rate, motion, time of the day, weather, and circadian rhythm. ðŸŽ¶

I use this app every day for several hours at a time. I am doing it even now, while writing this article.

> **Note**: you can try Endel for free by clicking on this [link](https://code.endel.io/?code=adrianpietrzak).

# Other tools

Depending on the type of software development, these tools change. However, I use several programs every time:

1. [**Brave**](https://brave.com/) - top one web browser based on Chromium engine;
2. [**Rectangle Pro**](https://rectangleapp.com/pro) - quicker window snapping on macOS;
3. [**TG Pro**](https://www.tunabellysoftware.com/tgpro/) for controlling my MacBook's temperature;
4. I clean the temporary files once a month using the [**CleanMyMac X**](https://macpaw.audw.net/c/3627891/66209/1733);
5. [**Postman**](https://www.postman.com/) - REST API client;
6. [**ForkLift 3**](https://binarynights.com/) - FTP client.

My experience has shown that you don't need many programs to produce software efficiently. Fewer programs keep your computer cleaner. This also helps to better manage the work.

In this article you learned about my list of applications for software development. I guarantee you that the programs listed are the best tools available at this time.
