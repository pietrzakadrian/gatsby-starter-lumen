It's been a very long time since I wrote an article, but that doesn't mean I've had a break from programming. On the contrary, I've been programming a lot and in that time I've learned new things.

One of them is passing the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. My learning took **7 days**. In this article you will find out what I did to get certified.

# Why did I take the exam?

Looking at the total IT industry and modern software development, I decided that a good direction in my career would be to become a **Cloud Engineer**. Due to my solid background in Node.js platfom and extensive experience in the e-commerce industry, this could help me achieve this in the near future.

# Before you consider cheating on the exam

If you want to take the exam in your home, you must show your room on the camera before the exam begins. You cannot have other devices and external display.

- You and your computer screen are recorded during the exam!

Speaking up, looking away will result in the examination being **terminated**. That is why this exam is so valuable, because there are serious limitations.

# Preparing for the exam

In the first instance, you need to familiarise yourself with the exam rules before you start studying.

- [Visit the site](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) and read all the information that Amazon has posted.

# Passing conditions

- You need **70%** correct answers to pass the test and be certified.

# Difficulty level

As I mentioned, my study lasted **7 days**. You need to remember one thing — the exam is straightforward but **not trivial**. If you haven't had experience with cloud technology before, you're likely to sacrifice long evenings.

- If you focus enough and take it seriously, this time will be enough.

# Learning process

> **Note**: Remember that it's not just about passing and forgetting. You want to become a cloud engineer. You need to know all this and be able to put it into practice!

This course is very good and gives you the best way to familiarise yourself with AWS technology. I used it myself and the first 2-3 days I watched and listened to it for most of the day.

Of course, you won't be able to perfectly master the AWS cloud in this time, but you will be introduced to the technology to increase your passing score on Amazon's easiest exam.

In my opinion the exam is not easy enough to pass above 70% by watching a one video for a few days.

- Questions can be complicated, answers difficult to choose!

If you already know what AWS is, it's time for a quick study on how to pass the exam, as we only have 4 days left.

With help comes the **brilliant** youtuber Cloud Guru, who in his videos solves similar questions that appear on the exam — **that's your fast lane to passing the exam**.

There are over 150 videos to watch and study. I advise you not to waste any more time reading this article and just start doing it.

Preparing to pass the exam is all about solving as many questions as possible. I watched all the videos in this playlist before scheduling my exam date.

In my opinion, the sources I have presented are completely sufficient to pass the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam.

# Summary

The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam is Amazon's simplest exam but it is not trivial. It is important to take this seriously and prepare solidly. **Much of the preparation consists of solving as many questions as possible**. I wish you perseverance in your goal. Good luck!
