One of the most frequently asked questions is what I do. In order to be able to answer the question: who is **Adrian Pietrzak**? - I will describe my way from childhood to where I am today.

I have always been interested in web technologies and was exposed to them at a very young age. I started learning HTML and CSS when the Internet was just beginning. I launched my [first website](https://komiksy.pl.tl) when I was 10 years old.
## First time

In 2011, I began my first YouTube channel where I posted gameplay videos, and that's when I started building a community. A few years later, I changed my content to entertainment and learned how to create viral videos. Within a few months, my [channel](https://www.youtube.com/pietrzakadrian) had 250k subscribers. By placing ads on the videos, I was able to generate a decent income from it. This marked my first experience in online business.

## Programming

I enrolled in part-time IT studies and started looking for a job. At the age of 20, I embarked on my career as a software developer in a small software house. This allowed me to acquire a multitude of new skills and gain valuable experience in the e-commerce industry. Simultaneously, I worked on my [open-source application](https://github.com/pietrzakadrian/bank), which garnered over 1k stars on github.com. My code proved to be immensely helpful to many developers worldwide. The same software became a part of my engineering thesis, which I successfully defended in early 2021.
